# Vet Business Academy's Abandoned Site

This source code supposed to be proprietary. However, they won't care the site anymore. So I publish this to GitHub for knowledge sharing. This site is using **Vue** with **routing** and **authentication**. So you could use this as an example for your ongoing project. Do whatever you want with this source, just **don't forget to credit my name** if you copy a lot of stuffs from here. Thanks!
